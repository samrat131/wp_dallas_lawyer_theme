        	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used at our site.</p>
            <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, etc., unless you choose to fill out a “Contact Us” form found on many pages of the site, or choose to email us directly.</p>
            <p>We automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our site, such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>
            <h3>How We Normally Use Information About You</h3>
            <p>We use non-personally identifiable information to analyze site usage (such as aggregated information on the pages visited by our users), which allows us to improve the design and content of our site.</p>
            <p>In the ordinary course, we use personally identifiable information you provide solely to respond to your inquiry. We will not contact you about other matters, unless you specifically request it, nor will we share, rent, or sell your personally identifiable information outside The Law Office of Walker Fults.</p>
            <p>It is possible, though unlikely, that we might be forced to disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or a law enforcement agency’s request.</p>
            <p>Also, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you transmit over the web, or that may be collectable in transit by others, including contractors who provide services to us.</p>
            <h3>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</h3>
            <p>Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.</p>
            <p>When you visit our website we send you a cookie. Cookies may be used in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>To enable the personalization features on our website (which give you the ability to recall recently viewed pages and see information which you have input online), and</li>
                <li>To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Two types of cookies may be used on this website, session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).</p>
            <h3>Disabling/Enabling Cookies</h3>
            <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features on our site if cookies are disabled.</p>
            <h3>Our Commitment to Security</h3>
            <p>We employ security measures to prevent unauthorized access to information that we collect online. However, we cannot guarantee the total security of your personal information.</p>
            <h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy policy for The Law Office of Walker Fults, or its implementation, you may contact us at (214) 797-1861. If at any time you decide that we should no longer hold any of your personal data, or wish to change the use to which any such data can be put, please let us know by calling us at this number.</p>
            <h3>Revisions to our Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to revise this policy or any part of it from time to time. Please review the policy periodically for changes.</p>

Therefore, please refrain from sending any confidential information to us until such time as an attorney-client relationship has been established. An attorney-client relationship in almost all cases is created by a formal fee agreement entered into with an attorney.</p>
